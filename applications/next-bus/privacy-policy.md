**1. Information We Collect**

1.1 **Location Data:**

- The App collects precise location information from your device to enable live tracking of the vehicle you are driving.
- Location data is collected only when you start a trip by providing the start and destination details. The tracking continues until the trip is stopped.
- We do not track your location outside of the trip duration.

  1.2 **Device Information:**

- The App may collect device-specific information, such as your device model, operating system version, and unique identifiers, to ensure the functionality and security of the App.

  1.3 **Internet and Notifications:**

- The App requires internet access to provide live tracking services.
- Notifications may be used to keep you informed about trip statuses and other essential updates.

**2. How We Use Your Information**

We use the collected information to:

- Enable and display live tracking of the vehicle during active trips.
- Provide notifications related to trip status and updates.
- Maintain and improve the functionality and performance of the App.

**3. Permissions We Request**

To deliver our services, the App requests the following permissions:

- **INTERNET:** To enable live tracking and communication with our servers.
- **ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION, ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION, and ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION:** To track the vehicleâ€™s location during active trips.
